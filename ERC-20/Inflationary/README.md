This contract extends the ERC20 contract from the OpenZeppelin library and adds the ability to mint new tokens. The mint function calculates the number of new tokens to mint based on the inflation rate and increases the total supply accordingly. The new tokens are transferred to the contract owner. The onlyOwner modifier is used to restrict access to the mint function to only the contract owner.
