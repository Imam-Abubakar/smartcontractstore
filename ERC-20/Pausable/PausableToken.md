This contract extends the ERC20 contract from the OpenZeppelin library and adds the ability to pause and unpause the token. The paused flag tracks whether the token is paused, and the pause and unpause functions can be used to change this flag. The transfer and transferFrom functions have been overridden to check the paused flag and prevent transfers if the token is paused. Additionally, the onlyOwner modifier is used to restrict access to certain functions to only the contract owner.
